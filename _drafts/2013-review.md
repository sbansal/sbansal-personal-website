title: 2013 - Annual Review
---

Here is a list of things that I wanted to accomplish this year.

* Execute 1 idea
* Travel to 4 cities
* Make a list of important friends and family and call them every 3 weeks
* Build and launch an iOS application
* Get to 160 pounds

Lets see how things went.

#### _Execute 1 idea_
This turned out to be a little bit vague as I don't think I paid enough attention to what this meant. Do I just need to build the application or get certain number of customers. This didn't work as I had expected it to.

#### _Travel to 4 different cities_

Mission Accompished. We travelled to New York City in January, then New Delhi in May, Las Vegas in July, Providenciales (Turks and Caicos Islands) in October and then I was able to able to go to Miami for RubyConf 2013. So I ended up going to 5 cities this year.

#### _Make a list of important friends and family and call them every 3 weeks_

I did make a list of important friends and family. However was not able to execute on the "giving them a call" part. This does feel harder than looks. I feel it is a lot harder to call people than send a text. But I wanted to call more and talk to people. I have to work on this.

#### _Build and launch an iOS application_

Fail. Total fail. This just didn't happen. I still have 20 days to go in the year. May be.

#### _Get to 160 pound_

Fail. Although I am happier at where I am. I started the year at about 185 pounds and have lost 9 pounds this year. I do feel better but still a long way to go.
