Here is a recent screenshot of my iPhone homescreen.

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

I take all my pictures using [Path](https://path.com/). It has a wonderful list of filters and I can share stuff with my closest friends/family. 

I use [twitter](https://twitter.com) for consuming news, articles, blogs, book recommendations, interviews, etc. 90% of the things I read/watch come from Twitter.

For managing email, I use Apple's Mail app and [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/). I will like to use Mailbox for everything if only there was a way to configure exchange server email on it.

I use [transit](http://thetransitapp.com/) for getting around the city, [Yahoo Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yahoo-weather/id628677149) for checking the weather, [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) for project management, [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios) for passwords and [Google Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354) for navigation.

Of all the apps that ship out of the box on an iPhone I only use Messages, Phone, Safari, Calendar, Photos, Notes and Music multiple times a day.
