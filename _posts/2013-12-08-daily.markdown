This is a list of things I _try_ to do everyday.
This list is inspired by Jack Dorsey's [talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEQawgkCMOU) at Startup School. I look at this list first thing every morning, a bunch of times during the day and right before I go to sleep.

# Do
* Drink only wine during the week.
* Be present and slow things down. Breathe.
* Drink 4 glasses of water.
* Sleep atleast 7 hours.
* Ship something everyday.
* Sit and stand straight.

#Don't
* No hard liquor or beer during the week.
* No sugar during the week.
* Wait for the right moment.
