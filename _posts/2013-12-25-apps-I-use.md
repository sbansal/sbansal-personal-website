title: Application I use everyday
---

Here is a recent screenshot of my iPhone homescreen. I have about 40 applications on my phone of which 17 are on my home screen. If I am not using an app several times a day, it doesn't stay on my home screen.
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

I take all my pictures using [Path](https://path.com/). It has a wonderful list of filters and I can share stuff with my closest friends/family. 

[Twitter](https://twitter.com) is my goto application for consuming news, articles, blogs, book recommendations, interviews, etc. 90% of the things I read/watch come from Twitter.

For managing email, I use Apple's Mail app and [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/). I will like to use Mailbox for everything if only there was a way to configure exchange server email on it.

I use [transit](http://thetransitapp.com/) for getting around the city. I fire up this application and it gives me all the transit options based on my location. Its great for someone who knows where they are going and just need information about arrival times.

[Yahoo Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yahoo-weather/id628677149) is by far Yahoo's best mobile product. You open the applicaiton and it gives you the weather for your current location with pretty background images and who doesn't like pretty images.

Apart from that I use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) for project management, [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios) for passwords and [Google Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354) for navigation.

Of all the apps that ship out of the box on an iPhone I only use Messages, Phone, Safari, Calendar, Photos, Notes and Music.

I am pretty sure my homescreen is going to look different 6 months from now. May be I will get an android phone(NOT!!). I will post another picture of my home screen then.
