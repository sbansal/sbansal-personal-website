description: The apps I use day in and out.

Here is a recent screenshot of my iPhone homescreen. I have about 40 applications on my phone of which 17 are on my home screen. If I am not using an app several times a day, it doesn't stay on my home screen.
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

I take all my pictures using [Path](https://path.com/). It has a wonderful list of filters and I can share stuff with my closest friends/family. 

[Twitter](https://twitter.com) is my goto application for consuming news, articles, blogs, book recommendations, interviews, etc. 90% of the things I read/watch come from Twitter.

For managing email, I use Apple's Mail app and the [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) app. I hope that mailbox will start supporting microsoft exchange accounts as well so that I don't have to use multiple email applications.

I use [transit](http://thetransitapp.com/) for getting around the city. I fire up this application and it gives me all the transit options based on my location. Its great for someone who knows where they are going and just need information about arrival times.

[Yahoo Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yahoo-weather/id628677149) is by far Yahoo's best mobile product. You open the applicaiton and it gives you the weather for your current location with pretty background images and who doesn't like pretty images.

Apart from that I use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) for project management, [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios) for passwords and [Google Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354) for navigation.

Of all the apps that ship out of the box on an iPhone I only use Messages, Phone, Safari, Calendar, Photos, Notes and Music. 

I am sure that my homescreen is going to change and I will post back again in 6 months.
