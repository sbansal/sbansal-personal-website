title: Goals for Year 2014
---

This is a list of personal goals that I would like to achieve in the coming year.

#### Get 100 paying customers for [Unagi](https://unagihq.com)
I would like to get a 100 paying customers for [Unagi](https://unagihq.com) this year. I am going to actively market the application and reach out to people via email/linkedin/twitter. My goal is to send out atleast 365 cold emails this year. I am also going to try and lurk around the forums where discussions around ERP systems happen.

#### Get to 170 pounds by June 2014 and 160 pounds by end of year
I am going to play squash atleast 4 times a week and start working out a few times a week. As far as eating better is concerned, I am going to cut the meat consumption and not eat any meat Tuesdays and Thursdays.

#### No credit card debt
I am going to pay off all the credit cards each month and carry no debt at all.

#### Have 100K in savings by the end of year
We have 55K in savings right now and need 45K more. Deepti puts 3K every month in saving which makes it 36K for the year. I need to contribute 9K somehow which is 750 per month.

#### Ship something everyday
I would like to ship atleast one thing everyday. This could be a blog post or piece of code or anything else. As long a commit is made to Github, it counts

#### Write 1000 words everyday
I would like to get in the habit of writing every day. It doesn't matter whether I am writing a blog post, documentation, white paper, email course, copy for the web site, it counts. All I need to do is to write 1000 words.
