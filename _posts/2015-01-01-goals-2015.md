title: Goals for 2015
description: Things I would like to accomplish in 2015.
---

I just finished my [annual review for 2014](http://shubhambansal.com/posts/review-2014/) and have been spending some time thinking about the things I want to accomplish in 2015. For the most part, I would like to build on things I started in 2014 and focus on getting better. However, there are some new habits that I would like to develop as well. [With our baby coming in April 2015](https://twitter.com/shubhambansal/status/536999771165429761), obviously there are a bunch of unknowns but I can't control them. I would try my best to stick to the plan and then optimize or change things through out the year. The only condition with each goal is that it has to be measurable. I should be able to look at the number and say whether I made it or not. So here are my goals for 2015.

#Get 100 paying customers for DomReactor

I would like to get 100 paying customers for [DomReactor](https://domreactor.com). Anything more than that would be great but the first milestone is to get 100 paying customers. We are very close with the launch of our application and plan on shipping it in the January 2015.

#Get to 160 pounds

This is going to be a continuation of my goals from last year. I want to get to 160 pounds by the end of the year and stay there consistently. I am going to play squash 3 times a week and then run a couple of times a week as well. Also I am not going to eat any refined carbohydrates on Mondays and Wednesdays. If you see me slip, yell at me please.

#Read 2 books a month

I would like to read more books this year than last year. Last year I read only 11 books and my plan this year is to read 24 books. I am going to update my [reading list](http://shubhambansal.com/reading.html) and pick the books from there. Also, it would be nice to read to my daughter once she is born. 

#Write 1 blog post a week

My main motivation behind this is that it will help me with thinking more clearly. I often find myself being stuck on an idea or an essay for days at times and the only way I can get over it is by practice. Just like good concise code requires a ton of practice, good prose takes a lot of perseverance as well. Also, <a href="http://www.shubhro.com/2014/12/27/software-engineers-should-write" target="_blank">writing promotes many of the skills required in programming</a>. This year I am going to write 1 blog post a week.

#Meditation

I have been fascinated with meditation for quite some time, thanks to <a href="http://vimeo.com/89426203" target="_blank">this video by Andy Puddicombe</a>. I practiced meditation sporadically last year but I was not able to keep it going. This year I am going to include it in my morning routine and practice 10 minutes of guided meditation first thing in the morning . I am going to continue using <a href="https://www.headspace.com" target="_blank">headspace</a> to practice meditation.


*These are my main goals for next year. Apart from this I am going to try and make some gradual behavioral changes throughout the year which is a part of leading a mindful life. I will continue to follow my morning routine and add [1 new habit every month](http://shubhambansal.com/posts/12-habits/) as well.*
